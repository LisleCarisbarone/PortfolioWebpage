        <h3> About Carlisle </h3>
          <p> I initially majored in History and Political Science  from the University of South Florida. But after gradutating from USF, I realized, while I had a passion for History and Political Science, there were not many opportunites to make a living in the currenlty hyper-charged political climate.</p>
          <p> After floundaring in several dead-end hourly jobs, I conlcuded that I wanted more for my life. At the advice of a good friend of, I began to look into computer based jobs and what I would need to pursue such a career. </p>
          <p> I studied for a year of on my own, utilizing such programs as The Oden Project and skillshare JavaScript courses, I decided I would like to do this for a living and looked to ThinkFul to jumpstart my career move and move me foward into the field.</p>
          <p> While I am only just getting started, I am very excited about learning to Code and develop Webpages and see what doors open up for me as I finished the Thinkful program.</p>
